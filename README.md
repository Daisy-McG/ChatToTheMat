## User Experience Design
### **The Strategy Plane**
Chat To The Mat is the idea of client Sarah C who would like her own chat application that is designed to her requirements. During the 
global pandemic of Covid-19, Sarah has found herself quite lonely and although there are many chat applications available, she has failed 
to find one she enjoys.

Sarah would like the application to have a premium subscription service where she can chat with other people from around the globe who are 
also serious about building deep friendships whilst also offering limited availability to non subscription users. One of the things she 
worries about is people abusing the website and other users, so she would like to be able to appoint moderators who have the ability to 
ban users who post malicious or abusive content, that spam or cause general upset with the other chat users.

The aim is to build a responsive chat application where only registered users can enter the chat rooms. Security features will be implemented 
and users must be verified before being able to access the main functionality of the site. User groups will be created in order to allow 
moderators to ban users who break the terms of conditions outlined for the site. Additional groups will be created that allow access to premium 
features and areas of the site that are available once a paid subscription has been processed.

#### Site Goals
* To give users a friendly chat environment that they can use to build online friendships. 
* To ensure that moderators are in place so that users can report any bullying, harrassment or offensive content.
* To offer premium subscription services to users in order to monetize the website for the owners profit.

#### User stories
* As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering.
* As a user, I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease on any device.
* As a user, I want to be able to chat with other users in the chatroom in a safe and moderated environment.
* As a user, I want to have the option of a subscription to access premium content that I may be interested in.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the staff of the website incase I have any issues with the site or encounter issues with other users.
* As a user, I want to be in control of my account information and have the option to update my personal information or delete my account.

* As a premium user, I want to be able to private chat with other members so that I can gain deeper friendships with selected users.
* As a premium user, I want to be able to access other areas that are not available to non subscription members.
* As a premium user, I want to be able to customize my profile with my own personal images so that I stand out.

#### Database Design

[ER Diagram](https://github.com/Daisy-McG/ChatToTheMat/blob/develop/readme_images/er-diagram.jpg)

#### Security 

Using config variables in heroku, all SECRET access keys are stored safely to prevent unwanted connections to the database.

Django allauth was used to set up user registration and built in decorators allowed restricted access to certain features on the website that are not intended for regular users.

### **The Surface Plane**
### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The header and footer background colour is #353535. ![Header & Footer](readme_images/header-footer.png)<br>
The main content background colour is #1b1b1b. ![Background](readme_images/background.png)<br>
The heading text and anchor link colour throughout the website is #ff914d. ![Header & Link Text](readme_images/headings.png)<br>
The main text colour is #eeeee7. ![Main text](readme_images/main-text.png)<br>

#### Typography
The headings on all pages use the 'Orbitron' font while the 
rest of the websites content uses the 'Roboto' font.

#### Imagery
Premium users custom profile pictures are added by url and rendered into an image tag. I do not own these images and did not upload them into the site.

### Differences to Design
The footer content was implemented different to the original design. Wire frames have the Terms of Service in the center above the copyright information. On a mobile this was implemented with the Terms of Service under the copyright and on larger devices, the terms of service is on the right side of the footer.

On the profile page, the buttons on the wireframe are side by side on the mobile version but they were implemented to be on their own lines as the 3 buttons do not sit properly side by side as they are too large.

500 Page image was removed due to an error with images not loading on the 500 error page. Content is displayed with a link to home page though. This bug has been documented in the TESTING.md file.

## Testing

### Test Strategy
#### **Summary**
Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README. 
All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages. All forms linked to PostgreSQL
must be tested to ensure they insert all given fields into the correct databases.

HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).

CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).

Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)
#### **High Level Test Cases**

![High Level Test Cases](readme_images/high-level-tc.jpg)<br>

#### **Access Requirements**
Tester must have access to the Django Admin panel in order to manually verify the insertion of records into the databases.

#### **Regression Testing**
All features previous tested during development in a local environment must be regression 
tested in production on the live website.

#### **Assumptions and Dependencies**
Testing is dependent on the website being deployed live on Heroku.

#### **Out of Scope**
Only test cases listed under High Level Test Cases will be performed as part of this 
testing effort.

### Test Results

Full test results can be found [here](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

### Project Creation
To create this project I used the `git init` command in the terminal from VS Code.

I then used the `git add .` command followed by `git commit -m "Initial commit"` and was then prompted to create a new repository 
with the choices of public or private.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

`git add <filename>` - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

`git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates"` - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

`git push` - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

## Credits

### Code

The Stripe payment was coded by following a [tutorial](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-stripe-subscriptions/). This included the python 
code and the javascript. 

The code for adding 1 year to date on the premium subscription services was found in this [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15741618/add-one-year-in-current-date-python/15743908) post.

### Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank [Sean](https://github.com/nazarja) for his help with figuring out and resolving my redirect function issue on user profiles.
